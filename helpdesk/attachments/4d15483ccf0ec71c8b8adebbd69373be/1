Dear sir/madam, i made two different mutibet on europa cup matches which i genuinely won with account name "jaywilly" but was graded as a loss. These are the matches below.
(Bet 1) Hannover96(first team to score) 70' win.
Lazio(first team to score) 10' win.
Bordeaux(win/draw) 1-0 win.
Hannover96(win/draw) 1-0 win.

(Bet 2) Lyon(first team to score) 17' win.
Benfica(first team to score) 60' win.
Victoria plzen(win/draw) 2-0 win.
Lyon(win/draw) 1-1 win.

Please i'll urge you to verify my claim/ bets (no.3 & 6 counting from the top) and pay me according because i obviously won.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Williams james.
