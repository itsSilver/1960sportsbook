Dear sir/madam, i made two different mutibet on europa cup matches which i genuinely won with my account name "jaywilly" but was graded as a loss. These are the matches and outcomes below.

(Bet 1) Hannover96(first team to score) 70' win.
Lazio(first team to score) 10' win.
Bordeaux(win/draw) 1-0 win.
Hannover96(win/draw) 1-1 win.

(Bet 2) Lyon(first team to score) 17' win.
Benfica(first team to score) 60' win.
Victoria plzen(win/draw) 2-0 win.
Lyon(win/draw) 1-1 win.

Frankly, i never used lazio and lavente in these bets.It might be an error from your system because they (lazio and lavente) are not even attached with odds on the bet tickets.

I would like to know why it was graded as a loss while i won both bets.

Please i'll urge you to verify my claim/ bets and credit my account accordingly because i obviously won.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Williams james.

Ps: For future reference i desperately need answers regarding why my bets are graded as a loss rather than a win. I am passionately appealing for your response.
